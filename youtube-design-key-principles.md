## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

This is perhaps the most interesting pattern from the design:

- **Video segmentation**: Videos are split into small chunks (typically a few seconds each)
- **Multiple formats per segment**: Each segment is encoded in various quality levels and formats
- **Manifest files**: These act as "indexes" describing available formats and segment locations
- **Dynamic quality selection**: The client can switch quality levels mid-stream based on network conditions

This pattern solves a fundamental problem: delivering consistent video playback over unpredictable networks. By allowing the client to intelligently switch between higher and lower quality segments on the fly, users get the best possible experience without buffering.

## DAG-based Processing Pipeline

For handling video processing at scale:

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Using a workflow where each step depends on previous ones
- **Massive parallelization**: Processing video segments independently across many machines
- **Worker orchestration**: Using systems like Temporal to coordinate the complex workflow
- **Intermediate storage**: Using object storage (S3) to share work products between pipeline stages

This pattern enables efficient processing of massive video files by breaking work into smaller independent units that can be processed in parallel.

## Multi-part Upload Patterns

To handle large file uploads reliably:

- **Client-side chunking**: Breaking large files into manageable pieces
- **Upload tracking**: Maintaining metadata about which chunks have been uploaded
- **Resumability**: Allowing interrupted uploads to continue from where they left off
- **Direct-to-storage uploads**: Using presigned URLs for client-to-storage direct uploads

This pattern dramatically improves reliability when handling large files, especially over unstable networks.

## Global Content Distribution

For delivering video quickly worldwide:

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Caching video segments at edge locations worldwide
- **Proximity-based routing**: Directing users to the closest available server
- **Tiered caching**: Using multiple layers of caching (CDN, regional, origin)

This pattern reduces latency by minimizing the physical distance data needs to travel.

These patterns aren't just useful for video platforms - they apply to any system that needs to handle large files, process data in complex pipelines, or distribute content globally with high availability and performance.
